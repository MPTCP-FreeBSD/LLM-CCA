# LLM-CCA
LLM-CCA (Large Language Model for Congestion Control Algorithms) is a project to optimise TCP congestion control using Large Language Model (LLM). It dynamically adjusts the Congestion Window (CWND) by analysing network state data (e.g., RTT, CWND, and throughput) to improve network performance in complex network environments and high load conditions.The goal of LLM-CCA is to improve the responsiveness and adaptability of traditional TCP congestion control algorithms to reduce latency and packet loss, while maintaining efficient operation on hardware resource constrained devices.

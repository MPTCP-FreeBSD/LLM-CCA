# LLM-CCA
LLM-CCA (Large Language Model for Congestion Control Algorithms) is a project to optimise TCP congestion control using Large Language Model (LLM). It dynamically adjusts the Congestion Window (CWND) by analysing network state data (e.g., RTT, CWND, and throughput) to improve network performance in complex network environments and high load conditions.The goal of LLM-CCA is to improve the responsiveness and adaptability of traditional TCP congestion control algorithms to reduce latency and packet loss, while maintaining efficient operation on hardware resource constrained devices.

## Folder Descriptions

1. **adaptive_bitrate_streaming**
   - This folder contains the main program files for LLM-CCA

2. **Generate LLM test images**
   - This folder includes the tools for visualizing the test results of LLM-CCA. The programs here are designed to convert test data into graphical images, facilitating further analysis and evaluation of the model's performance.

3. **Data Collection & Result data**
   - This folder stores the data collected from experiments conducted with the L4S architecture and LLM-CCA, along with the corresponding visual representations. It contains experimental results, performance analysis charts, and related datasets that support ongoing research and data analysis.

4. **Tutorial**
   - This folder contains tutorials on how to replicate the experiment.
